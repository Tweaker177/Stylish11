(Current GitHub version not same as tweak, may have errors in it. Need to go back through changes made from commits from multiple devices.)

A colorfully random way to customize the look and feel of your device, and add extra functionality. Color pickers and other new options added for iOS 11-12.1.2 Project has around 40 options, and can modify most elements of UI either randomly or with custom settings and colorpickers. 

Tweak uses CepheiPrefs by HashBang Productions and lCSColorPicker by CreatureSurvive, proper licenses apply to all code in their libraries/ framework.

Note: I've learned a lot since first making this and will eventually optimize the code, and work to improve readability, changing variable and key names, etc....Mainly added this to clone to my newer device(s) and start working on it from there.
